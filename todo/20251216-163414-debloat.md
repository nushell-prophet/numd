I would like to make the numd module more lean and to adhere closer to unix philosopy.
I've identfied that we can get rid of the flags:

    --save-ansi # save ANSI formatted version

in favor of

`numd run test.md --echo | save test.ans`

---

    --no-save # do not save changes to the `.md` file

if favor of

`numd run save.md --echo`

---

    --no-backup # overwrite the existing `.md` file without backup

git rid of this functionality completely, though we need to check that the file is in git, and doesn't have uncommted changes. No backup functionality is needed at all

---

    --result-md-path (-o): path # path to a resulting `.md` file; if omitted, updates the original file

`numd run test.md --echo | ansi strip | save test_diff.md`

And echo should already block updating the original markdown.
